# Libft
First 42 project : Libft

This is the first project at 42 school.
The goal was to code different functions to build our own C library.
The main.txt is a text file with main to test the functions individually.

## How to use
To use, the repository must be cloned, then you need to go into the folder and type `make`. When it's done, a `libft.a` file should be here, this is the one you need to include in your project.
